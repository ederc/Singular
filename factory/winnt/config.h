 * config.h.in - used by `configure' to create `config.h'.
 *
 * This file is included at building time from almost all source
 * files belonging to Factory.  Furthermore, it is (textually)
 * included into `factoryconf.h' by `makeheader' so we have an
 * installed version of this file, too.  This way, the installed
 * source files will be compiled with the same settings as the
 * library itself.
 *
 * In general, you should let `configure' guess the correct
 * values for the `#define's below.  But if something seriously
 * goes wrong in configuring, please inform the authors and feel
 * free to edit the marked section.
 *
 * ---RS---
 * This is the specialized version of config.h for compiling
 * Factory on Windows NT 4.0 with MS Visula C++ 5.x
