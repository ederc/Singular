 * Implementation of variant F5e of Faugere's
 * F5 algorithm in the SINGULAR kernel. F5e reduces the computed Groebner 
 * bases after each iteration step, whereas F5 does not do this.
 *
 * ABSTRACT: An enhanced variant of Faugere's F5 algorithm .

 * LITERATURE:
 * - F5 Algorithm:  http://www-calfor.lip6.fr/~jcf/Papers/F02a.pdf
 * - F5C Algorithm: http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.2967
 * - F5+ Algorithm: to be confirmed
